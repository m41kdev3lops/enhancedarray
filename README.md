# enhancedarray

EnhancedArray provides a very simple wrapper around the usual arrays with a little touch of OOP.

I encourage you to open the single file and look at the functions yourself. They're so easy to understand and follow.


## If it's that simple, why is it made in the first place?
Because I found it tedious and boring to use the built-in array functions of PHP because I always kept going to the docs to figure out
which paramater comes first. So I decided to save myself ( and others hopefully ) the bothersome.
